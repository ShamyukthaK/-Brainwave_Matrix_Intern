# ATM Simulation Project

This is a Java-based ATM simulation developed as part of my internship at Brainwavematrix.  
It supports basic operations like balance check, deposit, withdrawal, and exit.  
The project uses a simple CLI and core Java OOP concepts.  
Run it by compiling `ATM.java` and executing via the terminal.  
Developed with learning and practice in mind!
